# High Level Design

## Problem

The database solutions are dominated by the [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) that organize the data in tables with rows and columns. The data is queried with text based [Structured Query Language (SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). These databases have several shortcomings:

1. There is no direct way of representing relationships between tables, rows and columns (despite the name - relational databases). The typical solution is the use of meta data columns that contain indexes in another table (foreign keys). This adds complexity and makes it hard to reason about the data and their relations.

2. Tables have rigid data structure (schema) that is impossible to change after creation. This makes representing sparse data (not all columns filled) or new unexpected data (new columns) a very hard problem especially for database design. The typical solution is creating a new database schema and importing the original data which is error prone and cumbersome.

3. Text based queries are their own separate programming language. They require to be learnt separately, have their own syntax, parsing etc. This constitutes a barrier between the database (and the data) and the client (user). Due to the problem no. 1 (no relations in relational databases) they also tend to be rather complex and hard to author. 

4. Scalability of relational databases vis-Ã -vis dataset size is generally poor. The typical solution is the use of indexes - essentially an in-built meta data system that makes lookup in selected columns faster. This solution however cannot cope with the ever growing amount of data and requirements on the database performance.

Other properties of relational databases or their implementations however are good and needs to be retained by any new system to replace them. For example:

- Platform independent.
- Database transactions.
- Use as an embedded database (e.g. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)).
- [ACID - data atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID).

## Requirements

The solution to the problem is a database system that:

- Allow direct representation of data relationships.
- Allow changing the database schema (or even schema-less).
- Allow querying the database natively from a programming language.
- Allow embedded use.
- Allow server use.
- Allow database transactions.
- SQL compatible.
- Retain (constant) performance regardless of dataset size.
- Unlimited horizontal nad vertical scalability.
- ACID compliance.
- Platform independent.
- Platfomr inoperable (write on one platform, read on another).

## Existing Solutions

Some of the requiremnts can be met with [NoSQL databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL). There are many variants of such databases but one particular type is well suited for addressing most of the above mentioned problems - [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database). The existing graph databases (e.g. [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) or [OrientDB](https://www.orientdb.org/) however do not fulfill all of the requirements. They do not offer bindings for many programming languages (e.g. C++). They use their own text based query language. They do not offer an embedded solution. They are not ACID compliant etc.

## Agnesoft Database (ADb)

The **Agnesoft Database** or **ADb** is a graph database system. It comprises of two main components:

- Agnesoft Database (ADb)
- Agnesoft Database Query (ADb Query)

### Agnesoft Database

The specification of the Agnesoft Database component:

#### Graph
The main structural component of the database is the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database). The elements on the graph are nodes (points, vertices) and directed edges (arcs, connections) that connect the nodes. Every element on the graph has a unique indentifier that is used to access and modify the element and its relations. Elements can be added, modified or removed.

The database graph is:

- Directed graph.
- Allow multiple edges between two nodes.
- Allow multiple edges in the same direction.
- Allow edges connecting a node to itself.
- Allow cyclic graphs.
- Allow multiple disjointed subgraphs.

#### Data

Both kinds of the database graph elements (nodes and edges) have data associated with them in the form of `key-value` pairs. The data can be added, modified or removed. The data can be bound to a schema or be completely freeform. There cannot be duplicate keys associated with the same graph element.

#### Data Store

All of the database data including meta data such as configuration is persisted in a single file. The data is stored in machine independent binary format that can be read & modified on any platform. The file is protected via [write-ahead-logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging). Operations over the file are atomic (transactional) and [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant. The database performance is mostly independent from the amount of data stored. Accessing elements and data has constant time complexity. Searching the database has linear time complexity based on the searched subgraph. The data store allow concurrent reads but not concurrent writes.

#### Variants

The database can operate in both embedded or server mode:

**Embedded**

In the embedded mode the database is directly linked to the client program (either during the compile time or at runtime). It is accessed directly using application programming interface (API) from any supported language.

**Server**

The database server is a stand alone process accessed via a network (or a local socket) connection. It actively listens for new connections and processes network requests returning responses to the client. It allows concurrent connections and processing. In server mode the individual instances of the database can form a cluster and either replicate the data (sharding) or extend the available store capacity. The server mode provides credentials based access to the database.

### ADb Query

Commands to the database, regardless of the database variant, are issued in the form of queries. Queries in ADb are C++ objects with certain data fields that are used by the database to execute the command and possibly return a result. Query objects are constructed using a [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) in every supported language. The pattern intentionally resembles English and SQL. The query interface for every supported language including ADb's native C++ is generated from a query IDL.

The benefits of constructing queries directly in a programming language (as opposed to text based queries) is their inherent syntactic correctness, IDE driven autocomplete and performance (no need for parsing).

The queries support named placeholders and unlimited nesting.

### Interface Description Language (IDL)

The ADb Query IDL is using JSON as its main format. The IDL describes the query objects, result objects and also the builder pattern to create the queries. The IDL Parser is used to create the abstract syntax tree (AST) from the query IDL. The AST can be used by a language generator to generate code in any language (including C++). 

The reason for using IDL and code generation is to provide scalable & maintainable way to provide multiple language bindings. Every change to the IDL or AST generator would propagate to all supported languages. Furthermore having common definition of the object layouts on binary level for serialization of the queries allow them to be created in any language and interpreted/executed in ADb's native C++ without expensive transport formats (e.g. xml, json, yaml etc.) and/or need for deserialization.

### Examples

A query that selects all database elements reachable from element with index `10` that have an associated key "price" with value that is smaller than `10.0`.

```
//C++
const auto query = adb::select().elements().from(5).where().key("price").lessThan(10.0);

//Javascript
const query = adb.select().elements().from(5).where().key("price").lessThan(10.0);

//C
const auto query = select().elements().from(5).where().key("price").lessThan(10.0);

//Python
query = select().elements().from(5).where().key("price").lessThan(10.0);
```

The query builders are almost identical in most programming languages.
